# Product Overview

**The Cabinet** is a Chrome extension that provides professional tab management through hierarchical organization. It allows users to save entire browser windows as "Cabinets" and restore them later while maintaining the parent-child relationships between tabs.

## Core Features

- **Cabinet System**: Save and restore complete tab hierarchies from browser windows
- **Tree Visualization**: Side panel displays tabs in a hierarchical tree structure for easy navigation
- **Tab Relationships**: Maintains opener-child relationships between tabs
- **Professional Management**: Organize tabs like files in folders, with support for nested structures

## User Workflow

1. Users work with tabs in their browser window, creating natural hierarchies through tab opening patterns
2. When ready to save their work, they "cabinetize" the entire window, storing all tab information and relationships
3. Later, users can browse their saved Cabinets and restore any of them, recreating the exact tab structure
4. The side panel provides ongoing navigation within the current tab hierarchy

## Target Use Case

Designed for professionals and power users who work with complex tab structures and need to switch between different projects or research sessions while preserving their organizational context.
