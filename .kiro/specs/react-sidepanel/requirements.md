# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a React-based alternative to the existing vanilla JavaScript sidepanel implementation. The React sidepanel will provide the same functionality as the current sidepanel but with modern React patterns, improved maintainability, and enhanced developer experience while maintaining compatibility with the existing Chrome extension architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the React sidepanel to provide identical functionality to the vanilla sidepanel, so that I can seamlessly switch between implementations without losing any features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the React sidepanel loads THEN it SHALL display the current tab hierarchy in the same tree structure as the vanilla version
2. WHEN a user clicks on a tab node in the React sidepanel THEN the system SHALL navigate to that tab just like the vanilla version
3. WHEN tabs are opened or closed in the browser THEN the React sidepanel SHALL update the hierarchy display in real-time
4. WHEN the user interacts with Cabinet functionality THEN the React sidepanel SHALL provide the same save/restore capabilities as the vanilla version

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the React sidepanel to use modern React patterns and TypeScript, so that the code is more maintainable and follows current best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing components THEN the system SHALL use React functional components with hooks
2. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use appropriate React state management patterns (useState, useEffect, useContext)
3. WHEN defining component interfaces THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript for all component props and state
4. WHEN handling side effects THEN the system SHALL use useEffect hooks with proper dependency arrays

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the React sidepanel to maintain the same visual design and styling as the vanilla version, so that the user experience remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the React sidepanel renders THEN it SHALL use the same Tailwind CSS classes as the vanilla version
2. WHEN displaying the tab hierarchy THEN it SHALL maintain the same indentation levels using Tailwind padding classes (pl-0, pl-4, pl-8, etc.)
3. WHEN showing interactive elements THEN it SHALL preserve the same hover states, focus indicators, and visual feedback
4. WHEN rendering icons and visual elements THEN it SHALL use the same styling patterns as the existing implementation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the React sidepanel to integrate seamlessly with the existing Chrome extension architecture, so that it can be used as a drop-in replacement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the React sidepanel communicates with the background script THEN it SHALL use the same message passing patterns as the vanilla version
2. WHEN accessing Chrome extension APIs THEN it SHALL maintain compatibility with the existing service worker implementation
3. WHEN the React sidepanel is activated THEN it SHALL work with the existing manifest.json configuration
4. WHEN building the extension THEN the React components SHALL compile to JavaScript that works within the Chrome extension context

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the React sidepanel to have proper build tooling and development workflow, so that I can efficiently develop and maintain the React components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the React environment THEN the system SHALL include proper TypeScript configuration for React
2. WHEN building React components THEN the system SHALL compile JSX/TSX files to JavaScript compatible with Chrome extensions
3. WHEN developing THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading or efficient rebuild processes
4. WHEN bundling THEN the system SHALL produce optimized output suitable for Chrome extension distribution

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to choose between the vanilla and React sidepanel implementations, so that I can use my preferred version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is configured THEN it SHALL allow switching between vanilla and React sidepanel implementations
2. WHEN switching implementations THEN the system SHALL maintain the same functionality and data persistence
3. WHEN using either implementation THEN both SHALL work with the same underlying Cabinet system and tab management
4. WHEN the React sidepanel is selected THEN it SHALL load as the default sidepanel interface
