- [ ] 9. Implement keyboard navigation system
  - Create useKeyboardNavigation hook that manages focus state and keyboard event handling
  - Add arrow key navigation between tab nodes with proper focus management
  - Implement Enter/Space key handling for tab activation and Delete key for tab closing
  - Add Escape key handling for context menu dismissal and focus restoration
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.3, 2.1_

- [ ] 10. Add comprehensive error handling and recovery
  - Implement error boundary fallback UI that displays user-friendly error messages
  - Add retry mechanisms for failed Chrome API calls with exponential backoff
  - Create error state recovery functions that reset component state after errors
  - Add logging and debugging utilities for development and troubleshooting
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 2.1_

- [ ] 11. Create configuration system for implementation switching
  - Add configuration option in Chrome extension storage to choose between vanilla and React implementations
  - Modify manifest.json or create configuration mechanism to switch sidepanel implementations
  - Implement detection logic that loads appropriate sidepanel based on user preference
