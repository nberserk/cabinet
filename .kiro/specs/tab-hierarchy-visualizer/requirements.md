# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a Chrome extension that provides a visual representation of tab hierarchy to help users better manage and navigate their browser tabs. The extension will display tabs in a tree-like structure showing parent-child relationships, groupings, and visual indicators to make tab management more intuitive and efficient.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a browser user with many open tabs, I want to see a visual hierarchy of my tabs, so that I can understand the relationships between tabs and navigate more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the extension THEN the system SHALL display all open tabs in a hierarchical tree structure
2. WHEN a tab was opened from another tab THEN the system SHALL show it as a child of the parent tab
3. WHEN tabs are grouped by the browser THEN the system SHALL visually represent these groups in the hierarchy
4. WHEN the user hovers over a tab in the hierarchy THEN the system SHALL highlight the corresponding browser tab

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user working within a specific browser window, I want to see the tab hierarchy for only the current window, so that I can focus on managing tabs within my current context without distraction from other windows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is opened THEN the system SHALL display only tabs from the current active window
2. WHEN tabs are added or removed from the current window THEN the system SHALL update the hierarchy to reflect only those changes
3. WHEN the user switches to a different window THEN the system SHALL show the hierarchy for that window's tabs only
4. WHEN a tab is moved between windows THEN the system SHALL update the hierarchy to reflect the tab's removal from the current window

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with many tabs, I want to interact with tabs directly from the hierarchy view, so that I can manage tabs without switching between them manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a tab in the hierarchy THEN the system SHALL switch to that tab and bring its window to focus
2. WHEN the user right-clicks on a tab in the hierarchy THEN the system SHALL show a context menu with tab management options
3. WHEN the user selects "close tab" from the context menu THEN the system SHALL close the tab and update the hierarchy
4. WHEN the user closes a parent tab THEN the system SHALL also close all child tabs in the hierarchy
5. WHEN the user drags a tab in the hierarchy THEN the system SHALL allow reordering or regrouping of tabs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user who wants quick access to the tab hierarchy, I want the extension to be easily accessible, so that I can view and manage tabs without disrupting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the extension icon THEN the system SHALL open the tab hierarchy in a side panel
2. WHEN the extension is opened THEN the system SHALL load and display the current tab state within 500ms
3. WHEN the user uses a keyboard shortcut THEN the system SHALL toggle the side panel visibility
4. WHEN the extension is open THEN the system SHALL automatically update the hierarchy when tabs change

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user who values visual clarity, I want the hierarchy to be clearly readable and intuitive, so that I can quickly understand my tab organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying the hierarchy THEN the system SHALL use clear visual indicators for parent-child relationships
2. WHEN tabs have favicons THEN the system SHALL display them alongside tab titles
3. WHEN tab titles are long THEN the system SHALL truncate them with ellipsis while showing tooltips with full titles
4. WHEN tabs are loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
5. WHEN tabs are pinned THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish them from regular tabs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user who wants to preserve and reuse tab organizations, I want to save my current window's tab hierarchy as a named Cabinet, so that I can restore it later and maintain organized browsing sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user chooses to save the current tab hierarchy THEN the system SHALL create a Cabinet with all current window tabs and their relationships
2. WHEN saving a Cabinet THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to provide a name for the Cabinet
3. WHEN a Cabinet is saved THEN the system SHALL store the tab URLs, titles, hierarchy relationships, and metadata in browser storage
4. WHEN the user wants to restore a Cabinet THEN the system SHALL display a list of saved Cabinets with their names and creation dates
5. WHEN a Cabinet is restored THEN the system SHALL open all tabs from the Cabinet in the current window, recreating the original hierarchy
6. WHEN restoring a Cabinet THEN the system SHALL close existing tabs in the current window before opening the Cabinet tabs

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user managing multiple saved Cabinets, I want to organize and maintain my saved tab hierarchies, so that I can keep my Cabinet collection useful and up-to-date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing saved Cabinets THEN the system SHALL display Cabinet names, creation dates, and number of tabs
2. WHEN viewing saved Cabinets THEN the system SHALL automatically show a detailed preview of the tabs each Cabinet contains with their hierarchical structure
3. WHEN viewing a Cabinet preview THEN the system SHALL display each tab with its favicon, title, URL, and hierarchical relationships without requiring user interaction
4. WHEN the user wants to delete a Cabinet THEN the system SHALL remove it from storage after confirmation
5. WHEN the user wants to rename a Cabinet THEN the system SHALL allow editing the Cabinet name
6. WHEN a Cabinet contains tabs that no longer exist THEN the system SHALL handle broken links gracefully during restoration

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user reviewing saved Cabinets, I want to see detailed information about each Cabinet's tab structure in a compact format immediately upon viewing the Cabinet list, so that I can quickly understand what tabs will be restored without additional clicks or interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Cabinet list THEN the system SHALL automatically display tabs in their original hierarchical tree structure using a compact layout for each Cabinet
2. WHEN viewing Cabinet tabs THEN the system SHALL show small favicons (12px), titles, and domain-only URLs for space efficiency
3. WHEN viewing Cabinet tabs THEN the system SHALL visually indicate parent-child relationships with minimal tree lines
4. WHEN viewing Cabinet tabs THEN the system SHALL show tab metadata using small dot indicators for pinned and loading states
5. WHEN a Cabinet has many tabs THEN the system SHALL provide scrollable preview optimized for viewing maximum tabs in minimal space
6. WHEN Cabinet tabs have long titles THEN the system SHALL truncate them with tooltips, prioritizing space efficiency over full text display
7. WHEN hovering over tab nodes THEN the system SHALL provide subtle visual feedback with left border highlights
8. WHEN the Cabinet list loads THEN the system SHALL display all Cabinet details immediately without requiring expand/collapse interactions

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user concerned about performance, I want the extension to work efficiently, so that it doesn't slow down my browser or consume excessive resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is running THEN the system SHALL use minimal memory and CPU resources
2. WHEN there are many tabs open THEN the system SHALL handle large numbers of tabs without performance degradation
3. WHEN tabs change frequently THEN the system SHALL efficiently update the hierarchy without causing browser lag
4. WHEN the extension is not actively being used THEN the system SHALL minimize background processing
5. WHEN rendering Cabinet previews with many tabs THEN the system SHALL use efficient rendering techniques to maintain smooth performance
